        <h1>Team</h1>
        <p>Ananse Learning is a culturally rooted hybrid ecosystem that integrates hands-on materials with a digital
            platform to weave adventures inspired by Ghanaian and African culture. Guided by our Ananse Ntontan
            Exploration methodology, we turn learning into a living, non-linear journey. Children immerse themselves in
            story-led worlds by building knowledge offline with posters, storybooks, workbooks, and hands-on tools,
            while continuing the adventure online through maker-focused and audio-rich digital learning.</p>

        <h2>The Wisdom of Ananse Ntontan</h2>
        <p>Our name honours the Akan folklore, particularly Ananse the spider, a figure of wisdom, storytelling, and
            creative problem-solving. At the heart of this narrative is the Ananse Ntontan (spider's web), an Adinkra
            symbol representing intelligence, creativity, and the interconnectedness of learning. Just as a spider
            weaves strong threads into intricate structures, we integrate diverse subjects into a unified, living
            learning experience.</p>

        <p>Ananse (Oluman-Boogie-Annan), the weaver, is the parent (Ananse Learning) whose web of wisdom gives life to
            three anthropomorphic characters: Mansa the lioness is the architect of educational tools through Studio
            Mansa; Anansewaa, the graceful giraffe, is the guide of live, sensory experiences through Anansewaa’s
            Makerspace, and Brempong the bear, our chef and nourisher, is our food and culture companion who leads
            M’aduane.</p>
